# Liver-Tumor-Semantic-Segmentation-LiTS-
In order to obtain accurate liver tumour segmentation, this work presents a thorough methodology that blends active contour models with deep learning techniques. By combining transfer learning with ResNet50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, the suggested method improves upon the conventional U-Net design. This hybrid method enhances the model's capacity to differentiate between tumour and non-tumor regions in medical pictures by utilising ResNet50's strong feature extraction capabilities. ResNet50's weights are used to fine-tune the U-Net, increasing accuracy while reducing the amount of training data required. The main goal is to increase segmentation accuracy in clinical settings, where even little advancements can have a big impact on the results of diagnostic tests.The approach places a strong emphasis on flexibility, guaranteeing that the model operates dependably over a range of datasets with differences in tumor morphology, contrast, and image quality.
 
In order to maximise the model's performance, the preprocessing stage is essential. To guarantee interoperability with the U-Net and ResNet50 architectures, images are scaled to uniform dimensions. Inconsistencies brought on by differences in imaging equipment or processes are minimised by normalising pixel values to a standard scale. The training dataset is artificially expanded using data augmentation techniques including rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve the model's capacity to generalise to new data. These actions provide strong performance in actual clinical settings by reducing overfitting and enhancing the system's resistance to noise and artefacts. Because it captures high-level information while preserving spatial details, the U-Net architecture's symmetric encoder-decoder topology and skip connections make it especially well-suited for medical image segmentation. ResNet50's integration enhances this potential by increasing feature representation, cutting down on training time, and offering a comprehensive initialisation of weights.
 
The success of the suggested strategy is confirmed by experimental results, which show that both the improved U-Net and ResNet50-based models achieve an astounding 98% segmentation accuracy.  This high degree of accuracy highlights the possibilities of fusing the transfer learning benefits of ResNet50 with the segmentation expertise of U-Net.  The results demonstrate the system's dependability as a clinical tool for detecting liver tumors, providing a balance between diagnostic accuracy and computing efficiency.  To further fine-tune segmentation limits, future studies could investigate the use of more pre-trained models or sophisticated loss functions.  Finally, by showing how hybrid deep learning architectures can handle challenging problems in radiology and cancer, this work advances the expanding field of AI-driven medicalÂ imaging.
